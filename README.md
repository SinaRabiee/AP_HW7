# AP HW7 (Python comprehension list and matplotlib)
In this homework we implemented functions in oneline format (using comprehension lists) and a edited a picture using matplotlib.

## Oneline functions

### adjacentElementsProduct
Find the adjacent elements that have the largest product in a given array of ints and return that product.
```py
def adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray)
```

### allLongestStrings
Find the longest strings in an array of strings.
```py
def allLongestStrings(inputArray)
```

### checkPalindrome
Palindrome is a string that doesn't change when reversed. Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.
```py
def checkPalindrome(inputString)
```

### commonCharacterCount
Given two strings, find the number of common characters between them.
```py
def commonCharacterCount(s1, s2)
```

### areSimilar
Two arrays are similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at `most` one pair of elements in one of the arrays.Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.
```py
def areSimilar(A, B)
```

### palindromeRearranging
Find out if a string can be rearranged to form a palindrome string.
```py
def palindromeRearranging(inputString)
```

### arrayReplace
Given an array of integers, replace all the occurrences of `elemToReplace` with `substitutionElem`.
```py
def arrayReplace(inputArray, elemToReplace, substitutionElem)
```

### evenDigitsOnly
Check if all digits of an integer are even.
```py
def evenDigitsOnly(n)
```

### alphabeticShift
Replace each of the characters of a string by the next character in the English alphabet (replace `a` with `b`, `b` with `c`, ..., and `z` with `a`)
```py
def alphabeticShift(inputString)
```

### firstDigit
Find the first digit that appears in a string.
```py
def firstDigit(inputString)
```

## Matplotlib
Using the image in `resources/image.jpg` and matplotlib built-in functions and animation capabilities, we change the `image.jpg` to the photo showcased below.
